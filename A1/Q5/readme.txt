Kinda confused as to what the devlierable actually is for this question so there are 2 programmes


1. webcrawler.py
	
	Ensure metaploitable2 is running and the ip addressed is changed to the metasploitable2 ip address
	
	This script goes through the content in dirs.txt and outputs valid URLs (URLs that get a response starting with "2XX"
	
	
2. webcrawler2.py
	
	This script is essentially a sorting script. Since the question says to "print
all the URLs that have matching subdirectories in the file. "

	The script will go through the dirs.txt file and find subdirectories that have the same parent directory, ignoring whether it is a valid URL.
